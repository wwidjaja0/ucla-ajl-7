# Project Overview
There has been a pattern of dermatology AI tools underperforming for people of different skin colors as a result of the poor diversity of training data. This has played a detementrial effect on marginalized and underserved communities from delayed treatments and other health disparities.

This project is in collaboration with Break Through Tech, a Cornell Tech initiative that connects undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds to impactful tech opportunities and the Algorithmic Justice League, an organization that merges art and research to bring awareness on the social impacts and potential harms of artificial intelligence.

The objective of this competition is to develop a machine learning model that will be equipped to classify 21 skin additions across a diverse skin tone data set. 

By developing a model that is able to accurately identify skin conditions across all skin tones, this project can play a significiant rule in reducing health disparities in dermatology, aim to provide better treatment, and develop more accurate AI healthcare models.
